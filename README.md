IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION


Classification is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that involves predicting the class or category of a given input based on its features. It is commonly used in various applications, such as #imagerecognition #spamfilter #frauddetection, and #sentimentanalysis  

In the IRIS Flower Classification problem, the objective is to predict the species of IRIS flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. There are three species of IRIS flowers in the dataset, namely Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. 

Given the features of a flower, the goal is to classify it into one of the three species accurately. This problem is a classic example of a multi-class classification problem, where we have multiple classes or categories to predict.
